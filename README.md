# HackCMUProject
Our hackCMU project


We are creating a web-app based in Javascript using Node.js, name TBD.

In this app, people will be enter their demographic information, and a topic that they want to talk about. Alternatively, someone can choose from a list a topic that they'd like to talk about. They will be added to the conversation only if their demographic does not match that of others in the conversation already.

They will then be given a location, a coffee shop, to meet up at. The point of the app is to bring people of different backgrounds together to engage in conversations.
